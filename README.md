## Dinosaur Game:

A fully functional C++ game built in the linux terminal! Your objective is to dodge cacti as you make your way to the end of the stage. This game includes prcedurally generated clouds, parabolic jumping, collision detection, score keeper, timer, and cacti that move at random speeds.

## Reflection

This project was created in my 1a term as the final project for SYDE 121 (digital computation). The biggest challenge was getting real time updating in the terminal to the point where the game was considered "playable".
